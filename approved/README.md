# Approved data models

This distribution contains only those data models that are contained in the amendment to the Implementing Rules for Annex II+III themes, including the updates of the Annex I data themes.

NOTE: Regarding the mapping tables, the original versions in XML have been substituted by the Excel tables currently downloadable using the "[Find Your Scope](https://inspire-regadmin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataspecification/FindYourScope.action)" application, more complete than the original ones and easier to update e.g. when a related TG/Schema change proposal is endorsed.
